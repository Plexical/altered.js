# Altered.js

***TL;DR:*** *Reversible state changes, Javascript version.*

This module is a port of my similarly named Python module,
[Altered States](https://github.com/Plexical/altered.states). It's
purpose is reversible state changes aimed at e.g. testing. The
'Altered.js' name is mostly to distinguish from it's Python
counterpart, from here on I'll refer to it as 'Altered States' too,
and mean the Javascript version.
